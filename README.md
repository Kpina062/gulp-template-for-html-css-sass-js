# VALIDATE HTML
This task validates HTML pages. If no errors are found, the Gulp task will simply move down a line, reporting the task is done.

On error, however, youâ€™ll receive one or more messages about your HTML errors. These errors are reported as having been found at line and column values. For example, 1.5 means an error on line 1, column 5.
