# Compile CSS for Development Work
This task looks for a single Sass file (sassSourceFileForDev), compiles the CSS from it, and writes the resulting file to the cssDevDestinationFolder. The final CSS file will be formatted with 2-space indentations. Any floating-point calculations will be carried out to 10 places, and browser-specific prefixes will be added to support 2 browser versions behind all current browsersâ€™ versions.
