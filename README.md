# Compile CSS for Production
This task looks for a single Sass file (sassSourceFileForProd), compiles the CSS from it, and writes the resulting single CSS file to the cssProdDestinationFolder. Any floating-point calculations will be carried out 10 places, and browser-specific prefixes will be added to support 2 browser versions behind all current browsers’ versions. Lastly, the final CSS file is passed through two levels of compression: “outputStyle” from Sass and compressCSS().
